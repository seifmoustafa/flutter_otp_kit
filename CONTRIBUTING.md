      final config = OtpFieldConfig();
      expect(config.fieldWidth, 55.125);
      expect(config.fieldHeight, 60.731);
    });

    test('should create with custom values', () {
      final config = OtpFieldConfig(
        fieldWidth: 60.0,
        fieldHeight: 60.0,
      );

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use dartdoc comments (`///`) for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Document parameters and return values

```dart
/// Configuration for OTP field appearance and behavior.
///
/// This class provides comprehensive customization options for OTP fields,
/// including dimensions, colors, typography, and effects.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final config = OtpFieldConfig(
///   fieldWidth: 60.0,
///   fieldHeight: 60.0,
///   borderRadius: 12.0,
/// );
/// ```
class OtpFieldConfig {
  /// Creates a new OTP field configuration.
  ///
  /// All parameters are optional and have sensible defaults.
  const OtpFieldConfig({
    this.fieldWidth = 55.125,
    this.fieldHeight = 60.731,
    // ...
  });

  /// Width of each OTP field in logical pixels.
  ///
  /// This determines how wide each individual field will be.
  /// The default value of 55.125 provides a good balance for most use cases.
  final double fieldWidth;
}
```
